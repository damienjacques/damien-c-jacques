# About me

I am researcher in geomatics, "[the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information or spatially referenced information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics)". I am currently working as research assistant at ULB (Belgium) while completing a Ph.D. entitled ”Harnessing the Data Revolution for Food Security and Poverty Mapping: Synergies between Mobile Phone Data, Earth Observation and Official Statistics in Senegal” at UCL (Belgium).  

I am using mobile phone metadata (call detail records), Earth Observation data and other geographic data (vector, raster) for GIS, machine learning and other geostatistics analysis. 

I have a [blog](http://www.guru-gis.net) with some colleagues where we share some code related to geospatial analysis using open source language and software (R, Python, Qgis, OTB...).

I am also one of the founders of [STEMGARDEN](http://www.stemgarden.co), an online platform that promotes urban garden solutions.
