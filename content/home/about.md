I am Ph.D. researcher in geomatics, "[the discipline of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information or spatially referenced information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics)". I am working as a consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank for which I make poverty map in Latin America using mobile phone data.

I am using mobile phone metadata (call detail records), Earth Observation data and other geospatial data for GIS, machine learning and geostatistics analysis. 

I have a [blog](http://www.guru-gis.net) with a couple of colleagues where we share(d) chunks of code related to geospatial analysis using open source programming languages and  softwares (R, Python, Qgis, OTB...).

I am also one of the founders of [STEMGARDEN](http://www.stemgarden.co), an online platform that promotes urban gardening and farming solutions.
