'[Data for Development Senegal](http://www.d4d.orange.com/en/Accueil)' was an innovation challenge open on ICT Big Data for the purposes of societal development. Sonatel and the Orange Group made anonymous data, extracted from the mobile network in Senegal, available to international research laboratories.

The first objective of the 'Data For Development Senegal' Challenge was to contribute to the development and welfare of the populations. For this purpose, 5 priority subject matters have been defined, for which the requirements have been expressed in collaboration with the responsible Ministries or the partner institutions:
	
* Health
* Agriculture
* Transport/Urban planning
* Energy
* National Statistics

The results of the challenge were presented at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) during the [Netmob Conference](http://netmob.org/www15/index.html) in April 2015.

For this challenge, we were awarded the [Agriculture Prize](http://d4d.orange.com/content/download/43330/405662/version/3/file/D4Dchallenge_leaflet_A4_V2Eweblite.pdf) for our project '[Genesis of millet prices in Senegal: the role of production, markets and their failures](http://damien-c-jacques.rbind.io/publication/jacques-2015-millet-prices-netmob-d4d/)' (later published as '[Social capital and transaction costs in millet markets](http://damien-c-jacques.rbind.io/publication/jacques-2018-social-capital/)'). We have also received a small [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2014/10/OPP1114791) to support the follow-up research necessary to progress towards the development of products and services on the most relevant development opportunities identified during the challenge.
